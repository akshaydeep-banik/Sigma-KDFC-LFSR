# σ-KDFC-LFSR

## Word Based -- Key Dependent Feedback Configuration -- Linear Feedback Shift Register

This repository contains the evaluation of a method for using σ-LFSRs with key dependent feedback configurations in stream ciphers and analysis of its impact on resistance to algebraic attacks. Also, the generated key-stream is tested for randomness.
*Software evaluation of the algorithms using MATLAB.
*Hardware implementation of the algorithms on Xilinx FPGA using Verilog HDL.
